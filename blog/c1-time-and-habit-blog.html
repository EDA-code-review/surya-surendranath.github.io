   <p id="p3"> <br>Which time and habit technique did you try?</p>
    <p id="p4">
     I have tried the technique of "making it big by starting small". I will be trying "pomodoro technique" and fogg method for my
     <br>future assignments.
   </p>
    <p id="p5"> What did you find interesting?</p>
    <p id="p6">
     Since time is very crucial for doing all assignments works, I am trying to make some changes in my habits. By trying the habit techniques,I felt I can <br>easily complete the assignments on time. Apart from that, I will create some timeboxes so that I can get some extra time to review and analyse myself<br> how much I have learned.
   </p>
   
    <p id="p5"> What worked for you?</p>
    <p id="p6">
     The above techniques helped me to complete the assignments on time, that made me confident to do this course further with full potential.
   </p>
    <p id="p5"> Which will you experiment furthur with?</p>
    <p id="p6">
    I will experiment with pomodoro techniques with 25 minute time boxes daily. I will make everyday minimun 5 hours to spend with assignments with the<br> technique, which hopefully help me to complete the assignment before the deadlines.
